# Using truss

## File structure

You start with your definition file, named `svc.proto`, in the current
directory. The current directory should look like this:

```
.
└── svc.proto
```

Then, you'd run truss on your service definition file, like this: `truss svc.proto`.
After running truss on your service, two new directories should be created in
your current directory. One is called `third_party`, and the other is called
`NAME-service`, where NAME is the name of the package defined in your
definition file. Here's what that structure would look like:

```
.
├── NAME-service
│   ├── docs
│   │   └── docs.md
│   ├── generated
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── handlers
│   │   ├── client
│   │   │   └── client_handler.go
│   │   └── server
│   │       └── server_handler.go
│   ├── NAME-client
│   │   └── client_main.go
│   ├── NAME-server
│   │   └── server_main.go
│   └── svc.pb.go
├── svc.proto
└── third_party
    └── ...
```

Now that you've generated your service, you can install the generated binaries
with `go install ./...` which will install `NAME-client` and `NAME-server`,
where NAME is the name of the package defined in your definition file.

To add business logic from this point, you'd edit the `server_handler.go` file
in `./NAME-service/handlers/server/`, where NAME is the name of the package
defined in your definition file.

## *Our Contact*

1. Only the files in `handlers/` are user modifiable. The only functions allowed in the handler files are functions with the same names ias those defined as rpc's in the definition service; all other functions will be removed. User logic can be imported and executed within the functions in the handlers.
2. Do not create files or directories in `NAME-service/`
3. All user logic should exist outside of `NAME-service/`, leaving organization of that logiv up to the user.
